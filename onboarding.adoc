== Introduction

Contributors are the lifeblood of any open source project. Any project not continually welcoming new participants might find itself stagnating—or, worse, falling apart.

So any open source project desiring long-term sustainability should think deliberately about the ways it connects with, greets, and acclimates—in a word, how it "onboards"—new contributors. A well-designed onboarding process makes contributing to your project easier for participants, and it empowers contributors to positively impact the the work as quickly as possible.

In this chapter, we'll discuss ...

== The importance of an onboarding experience

In many ways, the experience of onboarding in a new open source community is much like one you might have in a new job.

For example, when you begin working in a new position (or in an entirely new organization), you'll need to become familiar with new people, new tools, new processes, new norms, new policies, and more. And you'll likely feel motivated to do these things quickly, because you're eager to demonstrate your value to the organization and become comfortable in your new environment so you can do your best work. The faster you feel like you're making an impact, the more likely you are to stick around. And the more satisfied you'll be.

But you'll also be joining a team with an extensive history—shared norms and customs, in-jokes, jargon, unspoken agreements, shared bonds, and a sense of collective identity. In short, your new team or organization will have a culture that pre-exists and pre-dates your joining it. Facets of this culture are largely intangible, but they'll significantly affect your ability to collaborate with others. An effective onboarding experience equips you to understand this culture.

All of this remains true of onboarding experiences in open source communities. In particular, open source communities present onboarding challenges like:

*An asynchronous and remote environment.* One of the great perks of a traditional office environment is that you  are close to your co-workers and managers for face to face interactions and you can find them for quick questions. In contrast, when you join a new open source community, you will likely work with community members in different georgraphies and time zones. So unless there are good onboarding materials such as documentation, video tutorials, wiki pages, and other resources, it's going to be more challenging to get started in open source communties even for experienced self starters. 

*Imposter syndrome.*  When it's more difficult to get real time help or feedback, people can easily get stuck with simple tools issues and feel less confident about their work. So a good onboarding experience in open source communities is crucial for newcomers not to feel discouraged in their early days in the community. 

*Significant variability.* No two open source communities are the same. Even for seasoned open source contributors, when they join a new community they will need to get familiar with new tools, new processes, and even new terminologies. Depending on the community, seemingly terms like contributions, community members, projects, upstream, etc. may mean something slightly different and can easily cause confusion for new community members.   

== Onboarding resources

A key tool (and practice) for working successfully in an asynchronous environment is good documentation. Since contributors won't typically have fellow community members available near them to provide impromptu guidance, it's important to have important community norms, decisions, and processes well-documented in much more detail than they might be in a more traditionl work environment. Whether it's a landing page, project documentation, wiki page, etc., a good set of references are crucial for new community members to get familiar with the community and get started. It's also important to ensure that the onboarding documentations are up to date and reflect the latest snapshot of the community's activity, so you want to make it easy for anyone to help keeping the contents up to date. An easy-to-use documentation tool definitely helps with this, but what's more important is to cultivate a community culture that impresses on everyone the need for reliable, updated documentation.

This may sound obvious, but another key resource for onboarding is other community members. Even if people do not sit in the same office, having access to experienced community members to help people get started and answer questions can help alleviate the sense of isolation in the early days. Something simple like  onboarding buddies who can jump on a welcome call may be enough for a small community that is relatively new. For larger and more established communities, people may have seen working groups focused on onboarding or even community members with formal titles such as coaches or mentors. 

Once people resoures for onboarding are in place, this information (especially on who to reach out for help) needs to be posted in multiple places so that people feel welcome to contact their onboarding resources and feel encouraged to ask questions. If getting help is difficult, new comers will feel discouraged from engaging with the community and even decide that the community may not be for them afterall.

Whether it's onboarding buddies, mentors, working groups, etc. you want to have a large enough pool of volunteers so that these volunteers don't feel burned out with onboarding activities especially as the community grows. What is important is to have a culture within the community so that there is an expectation on everyone to help welcome new community members. Ideally, what we want to see is a lot of people volunteering to help others whether or not they have a formal title as a coach or a mentor. If you have a formal program for onboarding working group, mentors, etc. you should not set a high barrier to entry for community members to become an official onboarding resource. The most important qualification should be people's willingness to help others vs. other factors such as their tenure in the community or technical expertise in the project. The people who are helping with onboarding do not need to have all the answers. Rather, they need to help newcomers find answers quicker and not work alone.

== Onboarding practices

When people join a new community, they may find following discussions on communication channels (such as mailing lists or Slack) to be overwhelming. To alleviate their confusion or stress, consider creating spaces in these channels specifically for new community members to use as they get started and acclimated. For example, dedicated channels such as "getting started" or "introductions" can be good places for people to feel safe asking newcomer questions. These channels also allow more experienced community members to assist with onboarding by helping answer newscomer questions or even simply by offering encouragement. It all goes a long way to making new community members feel welcome as they're getting started.

Once new community members feel oriented and comfortable enough to begin contributing to an open source project, their next questions will be "Where can I contribute?"

So to help newcomers get started, you may wish to develop list of work items that that new community members in particular can tackle. Many communities label issues in their issue trackers with something like "good for first time contributors," "good first issue," or "help wanted," so newscomers can more easily identify tasks with which they can help immediately. Issues with these labels could range from documentation errors, easy bug fixes, or other simple tasks that will help new contributors experience early successes and therefore build their confidence.Having a contact person (or people)  servinvg as mentors or coaches listed on these issues (in case people need help getting started) can also be helpful (more on this at the end of this chapter). Always remember: Issues that may seem simple to experienced community members might not be as simple for newcomers.

Many open source communities organize events aimed at connecting their members. Whether the events are collocated or virtual, they  provide excellent opportunities for community members to collaborate synchronously—and get to know each other in the process. These events could be summits, hackathons, user confernces, etc. At these events, consider creating special programming or spaces for new community members. You might organize formal orientation sessions as a "Day 0" event if your budget allows for it, even a lunchtime session at which newcomers can meet other community members so they know who they can ask questions to later on.

== Contributor pathways

Opportunities for volunteers to begin lending their unique talents to an open source project are called that project's contributor pathways. The greater the number of contributor pathways your project features, the more likely it is to recruit participants with the various skills required for project success.  

=== Typical contributor pathways (community focus)

. Documenting workflow and governance processes
. Onboarding and mentoring new members
. Localizing content into various languages
. Copywriting (for website, newsletters, blogs)
. Managing social media
. Organizing events

Does your project currently offer new (and existing) contributors opportunities to contribute rewardingly to (or even take ownership of) work in each of these pathways?

=== Typical community pathways (technical focus)

. Adding new features and documentation
. Fixing existing bugs and triaging issues
. Refactoring existing work to improve it
. Performing quality assurance
. Improving user interface and user experience
. Release engineering
. Creating and maintaining project roadmap
. Code and user interface localization

Again, ask yourself: Does your project currently offer new (and existing) contributors opportunities to contribute rewardingly to (or even take ownership of) work in each of these pathways?


== Mentorship

Mentorship means different things to people. The interpretations vary based on the individual, situation, context, culture, and more. For example, to some, mentorship is a formal activity with a schedule and agenda. To others, mentorship is an informal process amongst peers -- it can even be a one time conversation. If you ask people their definition of mentorship, you will most likely get wide-ranging responses. 

That is what makes mentorship important and powerful, it is both universal and personal. Universal in that it has potential to be a positive experience and personal because how it occurs (and is implemented) varies by the individual and relationship. 

Therefore, one way of thinking of mentorship is the following: mentorship is an action, experience, and opportunity to share what you can, when you can, how you can.  

== Broadly, why is mentorship important?

Mentorship is important. It helps you, it helps others, it helps the community, and it helps the project.

=== It helps you

The help you give has valuable and lasting benefits. 

- experience the positive emotions of giving back
- learn more about yourself
- find knowledge gaps in your own thinking
- learn something new
- expand your world view
- make a new friend, ally, supporter
- and more

=== It helps others

Mentorship helps folks navigating the different stages/circumstances in their life.

Whether it is with a specific project/initiative or as they start, grow and advance in their education/career or generally picking up new skillsets, mentorship has the potential for positive impact (big and small, yet valuable). 

=== It helps community

It starts with helping one person, who in turn helps someone else and the positive ripple effect continues. It can even be similar to a boomerang of help that returns to you. 

At scale, it helps contribute towards more inclusive, collaborative, helpful, and innovative communities. 

=== It helps the project

Mentorship in open source projects is important and valuable. 
In the sections below are additional details on its context and benefits. 

== Different forms/styles of mentorship

As mentioned earlier, one can think of mentorship as an action, experience, and opportunity to share what you can, when you can, how you can.  

In an open source project, this can manifest in various ways. It can be informal, formal, peer-to-peer, mentor-to-mentee, and other variants. The relationship dynamics can also differ, such to one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. The how and when communication occurs also varies, such as asynchronous or synchronous. The kinds of questions being asked and the responses can also influence how mentorship occurs. 

Another thing to keep in mind is how people mentor and the different roles they assume. Below are some type of styles (not an exhaustive list, there are plenty).

Educator
- Teach and inform on concepts, ideas, and more
- Help explain and clarify material
- Share knowledge and experiences

Encourager
- Provide encouragement
- Remind them of their progress, accomplishments 
- Fuel potential to keep doing great work

Listener
- Instead of solely providing answers and guidance, actively listen 
- Radiate solidarity and acknowledge that folks are being heard

Finder/Researcher
- Discover questions/resources/people that can provide insights

Connector
- Share resources such as articles, books, media, events, and programs.
Introduce people to each other

In summary, it is beneficial to acknowledge that mentorship can go beyond traditionally beyond providing guidance. There are various ways to mentor and in doing so, it provides valuable and lasting benefits for the contributors, open source project, and community. 

== Mentoring new contributors

Part of starting, or growing, a successful open source community is designing the community to be sustainable.
This means the project needs to be able to reliably, and repeatedly, bring in new people and help them become ongoing contributors.
Let's talk about how mentoring new contributors is crucial to enabling a community to be sustainable.

If this matches your projects's version of sustainable, then a mentoring program is absolutely crucial.
It's at the center of how to take a project from "three people who know and do everything" to make it something many people can contribute to in a self-sustaining fashion.

Self-sustainability is an important focus for a mentoring program.
And don't think I went from "mentoring people" to "a mentoring program" by accident.
Here's the argument:

1. If we can agree that lowering the barriers for entry into a project is key to bringing in new people; and
2. If we can agree that people coming into a new project benefit from having one or more people they feel permitted and even encouraged to ask questions and learn from; and
3. If we can agree new people having lackluster or negative interactions with existing project members is likely to drive the new people away; and
4. If we can agree that having a person (mentor, friend) for new people to turn to is a way to prevent the driving-away and especially prevent silent segfaults (people just disappearing with no explanation);
5. Then we can see that doing mentoring with even a tiny bit of repeatable process support is going to yield better, more satisfying results than an ad-hoc process.

Once you agree that an even a lightweight program is better than an ad-hoc process, we're going in the right direction.
With this in mind, here are a few absolute must-have elements to include in your mentoring program.

=== Written, iterative process

Even if it's lightweight, write it down and give it an initial try.

For that first e.g. six months, get a handful of volunteers to try out the program.
This gives time to work out the kinks in processes, and to attract more mentors for when you make the program more prominent.

When you have a process you have tried and tested once or twice, put up a "Mentoring" section on your project website and include links to all the elements of your mentoring program.

Make sure people who have even the slightest inkling of getting involved in the project can look ahead and see how they are going to be taken care of as a new contributor.

After each full mentoring period (refer to time commitment, below), conduct a retrospective to learn from the mentoring period and improve the process iteratively.

It's not just promising there will be a map and directions, it is showing the actual map and idea of what the directions will be.

=== Mentoring guidelines and a Code of Conduct for your mentors

Even people who are very experienced at mentoring benefit from having guidelines for how to mentor and work with mentoring subjects (mentees), mentoring ethics, and so forth.

I'm excited about this project I learned about recently, https://www.mentorship.guide/[an upstream guide to mentoring itself].You can use materials such as from that project to create the elements your mentoring program needs.

Mentors have a special role of trust—the project trusts them to represent the community, and the mentees (mentoring subjects) trust the mentor to lead them down the right path.
Mentors need to conduct themselves with an appropriate standard, and there needs to be a way to keep them accountable to that standard and report problems or abuses of conduct by mentors.
Such a Code of Conduct needs to be visible up front and prominent for everyone looking at your mentoring program.

Not having a Code of Conduct for your mentors, or making it hard to find, is a warning signal to potential new contributors that this project should be avoided.

=== Mentors make mentors

I've been thinking about this one a lot since https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2019/program/schedule/[I gave a talk about it at Open Source Summit Europe in October].

The key idea is that new mentors are made of people who have had positive mentoring experiences that also taught them "how to be a mentor."
Your mentors should be thinking overall and in specific instances, How can I help this person be successful at mentoring other contributors?

A new contributor who is mentored well can immediately turn around and offer similar mentoring lessons to other contributors, new and existing alike.

Even if you are just answering a question for a new contributor, how you answer that question is where mentoring comes in.
You can answer in such a way that this new contributor feels empowered to share their new-found knowledge.
If they take in the lesson of not just what was conveyed but how it was conveyed, they carry this simple lesson of mentoring forward with their own interactions across the project.

=== Easy norms for mentees

Unlike your mentors, you want the fewest demands and lightest burdens for your mentees.

This is information that should be prominent on your mentoring program webpages, and can cover:

* In our project, here is how to find and/or approach a mentor.
* What the work/effort commitment for a mentee is likely to be.
* Clarify the relationship, e.g., a mentor is specifically not a friendship role; the mentoring may be time-bound (six months, etc.) or otherwise have a box once left means the mentoring has concluded; mentors are volunteers and deserve equal respect; mentors are held to a Code of Conduct that mentees should know and follow as well. And so forth.
* What does a normal mentor/mentee relationship look like in this specific project.

You are looking for a balance where mentees know what is expected of them, while leaving space for the mentor to help grow that understanding of project norms, from technical to cultural.

=== Named person or group who leads the mentoring program

For everything from people being stuck through to disappearing mentors to Code of Conduct violations, there needs to be a clear and obvious person or persons to contact.

This contact information and its purpose should be prominent on your mentoring program webpages.

This group will be one of the rare areas of your project that maintains privacy and a well-understood barrier to transparency for specific topics.
Mentors need to be able to talk with other mentors to seek guidance; this group can provide that private space.
It can also help with any sensitive matters that arise.

The governance for this group or role needs to have a clear and short escalation path to the highest levels of project leadership.

=== A reasonable time and effort commitment plan for mentors

Mentoring relationships can last years or be completed in a weekend.
Make a reasonable schedule, perhaps one that is tied to your release schedule or other rhythms such as specific conferences or events you organize around.

In my experience so far, the six-month commitment seemed to work well.
It was enough time to get to know each other, talk through how I can help as a mentor/be helped as a mentee, and then some months in the middle for the mentees to actually get feedback on real activities.

Especially if you are starting out, you want to attract mentors.
If there is too long of a time and effort commitment, or if there is not clear closure to a round of mentoring, many potential mentors will not join or even inquire further about your program.

Making the time and effort commitment nebulous is like sprinkling mentoring repellant on your project.
Be clear on what participants are getting into, and your mentoring program can be on a path to success.

== Mentoring new community managers

In the early days of open source, projects did not have community managers.
Collaboration among developers was a given, and if you were lucky, some people in your community enjoyed tasks other than software development, like tending to infrastructure, organizing events, or leading a marketing team.
As open source has matured, there are many more projects created from within large companies, and these things are no longer a given.
Increasingly, people inside those companies are designated the Community Manager or Community Architect, and are tasked with ensuring that projects run well as collaborative, multi-vendor efforts.

Much has been written here about what a community manager may or may not do—but if one thing is certain, it is that projects evolve, and the role of community manager evolves with them.
In the life of a project, a time may come when the original community manager is moving on—to a different job, a different role in the project, or just taking a back seat because of life.
 During these transition periods, a new community manager may emerge in the project.
 During this period, it can be tempting, as the outgoing community manager, to jump in and start helping the new community person come up to speed.
 The risk, however, is that you deprive the new person of an opportunity to make the role their own.
 They will certainly have a different conception of the most important jobs to be done, and a different skill set to bring to bear on the project.
As a mentor, it is important to strike a balance between being a resource, sharing relevant history, and saying how things have been done.

Recently, my colleagues and I had a discussion about mentoring new community managers.
What is the best way for more experienced community managers successfully mentor newer community managers?
How can you help them to be successful, allowing them the very valuable space to try new things, even if they will potentially fail along the way?
How do you balance scoping the role, while allowing them to define the role in the way that they see fit?

=== Chart the waters

One of the things that is most useful when you are coming into a new role is a list of the people with whom you will be working.
If there are stakeholders who might be able to help you, or people you will work with who have concerns about community goals, this information will enable a new person to come into the role and avoid any pitfalls or faux-pas.
As the outgoing community manager, one of the most valuable things you can do for the new community manager is to introduce them to people who you have worked with, to smooth the transition, and ensure that they don't have to spend minutes explaining who they are and why they are turning up in places where they are not expected.

=== Give room to fail

A common theme among people who have had bad mentorship experiences is the omnipresent micro-manager.
One colleague described an experience where they took on a community role from someone who was stretched too thin.
However, everything that they did in the role resulted in email correcting them and telling them how they should have done the task differently.
As a result, they drifted away from taking on the role.
One question more than any can make a person in a new role feel small and inadequate: "Why didn't you just…?"

A new person in any role will do things differently than the person who went before.
There can be a few reasons for that. Maybe they don't know how to do it the way it was done in the past.
There may be reasons which led to you doing things the way you did, but they're unaware of the history.
It's also possible that they bring a different skill set and perspective to the role, and their way is just as valid and just as good.
Whatever the reason, avoid asking your mentee "why didn't you…?"

You have to give the new person in the role the freedom to do things differently.
Even if they make mistakes, it is important that they feel ownership over the role.
As a mentor, one of the hardest things is to watch someone struggle to do something which you have done in the past.
That does not mean that you should completely abandon your new community manager.
Instead of telling them what to do, ensure that you have good documentation for tasks they will need to do in the role, and point them at the documentation.
This gives them guided experience, will show up any places where documentation is lacking, and will also give them the freedom to tweak things along the way.

=== Help them with visibility

Ironically for the most public-facing people in a project, people in community roles can see their careers suffer for lack of visibility.
More than one person I spoke to has mentioned seeing colleagues have their career suffer because their management chain was unaware of the work they were doing, or did not understand its value.
As the experienced community manager, one of the best gifts you can offer a junior community person is being a credible cheerleader for their work.

New community managers can get stretched thin, or can focus their efforts on tasks that do not provide a significant impact on the community.
As a mentor, you have an opportunity to help them channel their efforts on aspects of the role that provide value to the sponsoring company, in addition to benefiting the community.
You may also have the ability to communicate their successes in a way that will help their management chain understand the value that they bring to the project.
