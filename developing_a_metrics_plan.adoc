== *Why metrics are important in Open Source communities*

=== *Provide objective measures*
For any organization, you want to have a set of objective measurement to help you understand how you are performing. For businesses, it could be things like revenue, new customer aquisitions, costs, etc. that you can look at periodically (e.g. quarter-over-quarter) to measure how you are progressing. For open source projects, it is also helpful to have a set of metrics that can help measure the health of your community.  These could include things like number of contributors, how long it takes to close bugs/issues, responsiveness of reviewers, contributor diversity, etc. 

=== *Transparency*
Know who is contributing and where contributions are happening (especially as project/community grows)

=== Encourage community participation: Are new contributors joining the community? Who are some of the regular contributors in the community? 
=== Identify potential bottlenecks in the community: Are bugs/issues being close in a reasonable timeframe? Are reviews happening in timely manner? 


== Choosing the right metrics for your community


== Developing metrics for your community

=== Take advantage of APIs, dashboards, plug-ins, etc. that are available in your software tools (e.g. forums, code repositories, issue trackers, wikiâ€™s, etc.)
=== Resources/examples from other communities: Lot of communities have good documentation/code for their dashboards (e.g. CNCF, Ruby, etc.)  
=== The CHAOSS project (https://chaoss.community) develops metrics definition and sample implementation for open source communities. 

== Metrics pitfalls

=== Examples of poor uses of metrics (esp. in Open Source communities). 
=== Shortcomings of metrics


== Metrics dos and don'ts 

=== Dos: Make metric public; use metrics for spotting outliers; Metrics should be used for gaining further insight into community health.
=== Dont's: Using metrics as a sole basis for rewards; presenting metrics without proper context; ignoring non-metrics. 


== Parting thoughts, resources, etc. 
 
=== Your metrics should evolve with your community/Set of metrics you use should not be set in stone.
=== Remember to continue having hallway conversations with the community.
